# ConcurrentBoW
Study the concept and algorithm of Bag-of-words (BoW). Design and implement a sequential and two (2) versions of the BoW algorithm in Java. Then, develop an application to count and display frequencies of words in large text files using the sequential and concurrent BoW implementations. Compare the performances of the three implementations.
